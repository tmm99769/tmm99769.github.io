	<p>  The ginkgo <i>(Ginkgo biloba)</i> is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in 
the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,”in that there are no closely related species
still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.</p> <p> An unusual biological feature of the gink
go is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”), meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees, although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter). </p>
<p>Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated to be 3,000 years old.</p>
